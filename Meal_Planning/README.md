This project automates your meal planning and grocery list writing by pulling from an excel sheet with a list of recipes and their ingredients, randomly selecting 5 meals (with some requirements), and then spitting out your meal plan and your grocery list for those meals. The requirements include things like limiting to only one difficult meal per week, not repeating a meal from the previous week, etc.

What used to take me at least 3 hours a week now is now done in a few seconds.
